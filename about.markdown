## Hi there!

![Hamza Mujtaba](/Hamza.png){: width="250" }

My name is Hamza Mujtaba, and I'm an undergraduate student pursuing a degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering at The University of Texas at Austin. I'm passionate about developing software and hardware systems that have a positive impact on people's lives, and I'm constantly looking for opportunities to learn and grow as an engineer.

Currently, I work as a Research Assistant at the Texas Spacecraft Laboratory, where I'm part of the Computer Vision team. We're developing a relative-pose estimation model that can identify ESPA-Class satellites from RGB and IR data. Additionally, I'm working on a plugin that will work with RavenML, a custom CLI tool for model training that can be deployed on an EC2 instance on AWS. Find out more about our research [here](https://sites.utexas.edu/tsl/).

I'm also a member of Longhorn Racing Solar's Data Acquisition Team, where I'm developing simulation software for LHR's next-generation solar car using the Chrono multi-physics engine. I'm responsible for designing race strategies for track and cross-country races that account for weather conditions, track surface, battery level, solar array power output, and vehicle dynamics. Check out our [website](https://www.longhornracing.org/solar-vehicle) to learn more about our team!

Previously, I worked as a Software Engineering Intern at Dell Technologies Client Solutions Group, where I developed encryption and decryption software for the My Dell application that customers utilize to manage their devices. I also analyzed market projections, telemetry, and competitor systems to develop proposals for a new product registration system. As part of a Scrum team, I helped plan, implement, and release new software.

In my spare time, I enjoy working on personal projects that combine my technical skills with my interests. One of my recent projects is [Electrify](https://electrify-e4305.web.app), a web app that uses computer vision to identify the value and maximum wattage of a resistor from an image. I built this app using Node.js, Python, HTML, CSS, and the RoboFlow API, and it's hosted on Google Firebase. Feel free to check it out!

When I'm not working on engineering projects, I enjoy learning about new technologies and exploring different fields of study. I'm particularly interested in embedded systems, IoT, computer vision, autonomous systems, and dev-ops. Outside of engineering, I enjoy traveling (check out my [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/mujpics/) for more!), playing tennis, and messing around with my HomeLab.

Thank you for taking the time to learn about me and my work. If you have any questions or would like to connect, please feel free to reach out to me via LinkedIn or email.
